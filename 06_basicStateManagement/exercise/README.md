# Basic state management

Goals

- Write tests for `markTodoCompleted`, which takes a todo id and marks it completed
- Implement `markTodoCompleted` and give it to the `Todo`, which will fire when the checkbox is changed
- Extract the state changing logic to a separate file, `stateReducer.js`
- Marvel at how your code is more cleanly separated into presentational and business logic
