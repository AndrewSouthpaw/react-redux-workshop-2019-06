Arrrrrr they're just so cool.

Goals

- Refactor the app to use hooks and stateless functional components

CHALLENGE MODE üèÖ:

- Extract behavior of selecting only one option at a time into a `useRadioBehavior` hook
- Apply that to a new custom list, where the items can be selected, only one highlighted at a time
- Find opportunities to refactor this into declarative code
