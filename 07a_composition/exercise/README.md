# Composition

Goals

- Extract a `Modal` component to get rid of all of that boilerplate
- Extract a `Button` component
- Extract a `List` component
- Think about what's the difference between passing data in as children vs. as a prop
- Create a few typical form controls (e.g. text input, checkboxes, etc.) and think about how you'd want to use composition to make them reusable
