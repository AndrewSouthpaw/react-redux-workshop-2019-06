# Goal

- Install redux devtools and initialize it in the app
- Someone says they couldn't uncheck a todo... 🐞
- Figure out the steps to reproduce the bug
- Generate a test using redux devtools and correct the expected state to be what you'd actually expect (i.e. create a failing test)
- Make the test pass
