# Thunks

- Eric Raymond rejects "a couple of onomatopoeic myths circulating about the origin of this term" and cites the inventors of the thunk recalling that the term "was coined after they realized (in the wee hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60 could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought ... In other words, it had 'already been thought of'; thus it was christened a thunk, which is 'the past tense of "think" at two in the morning'. See: Raymond, Eric S. (1996). Raymond, Eric S. (ed.).

- Technically, it's a function that takes no arguments. redux-thunk breaks that.
- called redux thunk because it teaches redux to recognize functions passed to it, and runs those asynchronously
