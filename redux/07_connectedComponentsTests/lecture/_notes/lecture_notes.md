# Testing Connected Components

- Show mounting something with a Provider
- Write test for displaying UI behavior
- Start with `shallow` test and show how tests can pass without having correct behavior
- Demonstrate challenges with awaiting promises
- Create a helper `mountWithRedux`
- Show why you can't pass in props directly for easier testing
- Create a `FakeProvider` helper
- Talk about using `this.props.dispatch` vs. object shorthand and implications with testing
