# Running a module

Navigate into the exercise/lecture, then run:

```
$ yarn start
```

This will launch the dev server that lets you run the app.

# Running tests

Navigate into the exercise/lecture, then run:

```
$ yarn test
```

The watch functionality has issues with longer `console.log` debug statements, so if you find your debug printouts getting cut off, you can change to run tests on all files (press `a`).
